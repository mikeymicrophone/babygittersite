babygitter is a library that helps you keep track of what <i>exactly</i> is deployed.  there is nothing deployment-related in the code yet but it is intended as an after-deploy hook.
<br><br>
what can babygitter do for you?  well it will help you and your clients keep track of what code produced the site you are looking at.  there are many features planned for streamlining your process of discovering what your next step is.  for the adventurous, we might even implement some links that will check out different revisions and restart your server.
<br><br>
thanks for coming to the site!  I'll add more info shortly, and I might need your help.  for now, you are advised to continue on to github.
